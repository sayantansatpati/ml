    "**What is a merge sort? Where is it used in Hadoop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm [O(nlogn)] which works by recursively dividing an unsorted array till the individual lists are of size 1, and then merging the sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hadoop Merge Sort is used in the following places:\n",
    "Each mapper produces a sorted spill file (if it exceeds memory limitations) for each Reducer. Once the mappers are done processing on a single m/c, the spill files for each reducer are merged together by the combiner.\n",
    "Similarly, before the reduce phase, the sorted files from different mapper m/c(s) are merged together by a combiner before streaming the data to the reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is  a combiner function in the context of Hadoop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Combiner is used in 1) Combine outputs from several mappers running on the same m/c, so that less amount of data is transferred over network & 2) Combine the outputs from different mapper m/c(s), before the data is streamed to the reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Give an example where it can be used and justify why it should be used in the context of this problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in the Word Count problem, stop words (\"the\", \"for\", \"an\" etc) might occur very frequently. Instead of passing the tuple (\"the\", 1) 1 million times over network, the combiner acts an in-mapper mini reducer & combines the output of all the mappers running on the same m/c passing a single tuple (\"the\", 1000000), which  is much more efficient. However, there is a restriction - combiner can only be used when the function you want to apply to is both commutative (Ex: x + y = y + x), and associative (Ex: x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z). It can be used in Word Count problem since sum of the whole is equal to sum of its parts. But, it cannot be used to calculate something like a Median of a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Hadoop shuffle?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop shuffle is the process of transferring data from mappers to reducers. It essentially involves **partition, sort, and combine** phases. Each mapper processes a chunk of the input data depending on the block size (64MB, 128 MB etc) and creates records for each Reducer (taking Partition Logic into consideration). These in-memory records might get written into disk as sorted spill files. Once all the mappers are done processing on a single m/c, the combiner may kick in and combine the data (multiple spill files) for each reducer using Merge Sort. Once all the mappers are done processing, the combined spill files (meant for each reducer) are transferred over network to the reducer node, where they are all Merge Sorted by the Combiner before streaming the sorted file to the Reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Apriori algorithm? Describe an example use in your domain of expertise. Define confidence and lift.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Per wikipedia, Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I work for ebay in the Search and Information Retrieval Space. Apriori Algorithm is used to power the related searches functionality in ebay. It shows related searches (based on keywords) to an user by mining the data on what other users might have searched when the searched using the same keyword that the current user has used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Confidence(X => Y)** : is the proportion the transactions that contains X, which also contains Y.\n",
    "* **Lift (X => Y)** : In general, if we have a high Support and a high Confidence, this means we have a strong association. However, this can be deceptive in some cases because if Item X and Item Y have a high support, we can have a high value for confidence even when they are independent. A better measure to judge the strength of an association rule is the Lift. The Lift ratio is the confidence of the rule divided by the confidence assuming the consequent (Item Y) and the antecedent (Item X) are independent"

The mapper would load L1 into a Dictionary (Ex: key=item1, value=102 etc). It would also create a candidate generation C2 by taking all combination pairs from L1 and create another Dictionary where keys are candidate pairs;values can be anyting like '-'. C2 would look like the following:\n",

    "  (item1, item2) -\n",

    "  * **Reducer**: Hadoop framework would make sure Reducer receives the values for the same keys. The job of the reducer would be to sum the values for same keys, and emit only those that are > support count (Ex: s=100), just like in the 1st pass. Since the output from Reducer is not supposed to be a very big file (Though it will be much bigger than the file from 1st pass), the number of reducer would be passed as 1 to the Hadoop Job, so that only one output file is generated from this pass. The output of the reducer (L2) would look like the following. \n",

    "  item1,item3 240\n",

    "  * **Mapper**: The output file from 2nd pass would be passed to the Mapper in the form of a Distributed Cache. Assuming this file is small it is loaded into the memory, as a Dictionary, of the m/c(s) runnning mappers. The mapper would read portion of the Document D passed to it, read line by line, and emit the following as long as the line has the candidate pairs. The mapper would emit something like the following if a candidate pair is present in the Document D:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  item1,item2,* 150\n",
    "  item1,item2,item4 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  * **Reducer**: Paritioning has to be done based on the leftmost item, which would ensure all records with the same leftmost item would be passed to the same reducer. And secondary sort would ensure that the reducer would get to read the total before it starts calculating the confidence scores."
