Assuming this file is small (Typical Super Store doesn't have more than 10,000 or so frequently sold items) it is loaded into the memory of the m/c(s) runnning mappers. The mapper would load L1 into a Dictionary (Ex: key=item1, value=102 etc). It would also create a candidate generation C2 by taking all combination pairs from L1 and create another Dictionary where keys are candidate pairs;values can be anyting like '-'. C2 would look like the following:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  (item1, item2) -\n",
    "  (item1, item3) -\n",

    "  * **Reducer**: Hadoop framework would make sure Reducer receives the values for the same keys. The job of the reducer would be to sum the values for same keys, and emit only those that are > support count (Ex: s=100), just like in the 1st pass. Since the output from Reducer is not supposed to be a very big file (Though it will be much bigger than the file from 1st pass), the number of reducer would be passed as 1 to the Hadoop Job, so that only one output file is generated from this pass. The output of the reducer (L2) would look like the following. \n",

    "  item1,item3 240\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "#### 3rd Pass:\n",
    "  * **Mapper**: The output file from 2nd pass would be passed to the Mapper in the form of a Distributed Cache. Assuming this file is small it is loaded into the memory, as a Dictionary, of the m/c(s) runnning mappers. The mapper would read portion of the Document D passed to it, read line by line, and emit the following as long as the line has the candidate pairs. The mapper would emit something like the following if a candidate pair is present in the Document D:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  item1,item2,* 150\n",
    "  item1,item2,item4 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  * **Reducer**: Paritioning has to be done based on the leftmost item pair (item1,item2), which would ensure all records with the same item pair would be passed to the same reducer. And secondary sort would ensure that the reducer would get to read the total (item1,item2,* 150) before it starts calculating the confidence scores. Each reducer would need to store the confidence scores in memory to be able to spit out the top 5 once the processing is done. If the number of records exceeds the memory of the reducer, then top 5 has to be recomputed every time a confidence score is calculated by the reducer."
